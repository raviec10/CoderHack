# CoderHack

While coding platforms usually host multiple contests while maintaining numerous leaderboards, this assignment requires you to design a service for managing the leaderboard of a specific contest.

# Problem Statement

Develop a RESTful API service using Spring Boot to manage the Leaderboard for a Coding Platform while using MongoDB to persist the data.

# Problem Description

While coding platforms usually host multiple contests while maintaining numerous leaderboards, this assignment requires you to design a service for managing the leaderboard of a specific contest. Assume the platform has only one contest with a single leaderboard. The platform also gives virtual awards to the users called Badges based on their score. 

# Requirements

The API must handle CRUD operations for competing user registrations
Each user has the following fields: 
User ID (Unique Identifier)
Username
Score (0 <= Score <= 100)
Badges (Code Ninja, Code Champ, Code Master)
User registration requests must have a User ID and Username
The score must be 0, and the badges must be empty initially after the registration
Updation through PUT requests is only allowed for Score
Badges must be awarded based on the score:
1 <= Score < 30 -> Code Ninja
30 <= Score < 60 -> Code Champ
60 <= Score <= 100 -> Code Master
A user can only have a maximum of three unique badges
{Code Ninja, Code Champ, Code Master} -> Valid
{Code Ninja} -> Valid
{Code Ninja, Code Champ, Code Master, Code Ninja} -> Invalid
User retrieval must be sorted based on the score
Sorting should have the time complexity of O(nlogn)
Include basic JUnit test cases to verify the operations
Validation and Error Handling
Add basic validation for all fields (Ex. Score > 0)
Handle common errors and return appropriate HTTP codes (Ex. 404, User not found)

# Endpoints

GET /users - Retrieve a list of all registered users
GET /users/{userId} - Retrieve the details of a specific user
POST /users - Register a new user to the contest
PUT /users/{userId} - Update the score of a specific user
DELETE /users/{userId} - Deregister a specific user from the contest
Publishing and Documentation
Publish your code to a public GitHub repository
Write meaningful commit messages (optional)
Include a descriptive README.MD for your application codebase
Create and add a public Postman Collection in the README.MD

# Additional Notes

Implement the solution using a layered approach - Ex. Entity, Controller, Service, Repository
